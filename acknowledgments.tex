Thanks go to Sonja Keel, Raphael Roth, Renato Spahni, and Johannes
Rempfer who read parts of my thesis and resolved my ``mess''. And
additional thanks go to Renato and also to Marco Steinacher, who are
unbelievably valuable colleagues when it comes to model development
and coding. Special thanks go to my friends Alexander 'Humboldt'
Nauels, and Flavio Lehner who often turned up around 12.15 behind my desk,
peeking over my shoulders, making fun of nerdy code and beautiful
bicycles appearing on my screen and waving the red plastic thing to
be filled with delicious pasta. You all created a very stimulating
environment and are to be held accountable for making these last years
an extremely valuable and also very pleasant time for me.\\

But nothing would be working without my family's supporting. H\"usi
and Fr\"anze, Sarah, and M\"utti. And after these special years I
personally would not be working without Noriminori, my dear and beloved.
